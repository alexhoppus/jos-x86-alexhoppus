<b>What is this</b></br>
This is my fork of JOS operating system - educational os written by MIT guys that teaches the fundamentals of engineering operating systems.
The JOS operating system, have Unix-like functions (e.g., fork, exec), and implemented in an exokernel style 
(i.e., the Unix functions are implemented mostly as user-level library instead of built-in to the kernel). 
The major parts of the JOS operating system are: </br>
Booting </br>
Memory management </br>
User-level environments </br>
Preemptive multitasking </br>
File system and spawn </br>
